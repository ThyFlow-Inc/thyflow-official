# Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

I don't want to be rescued. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? What are their names?

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I can explain. It's very valuable. So, how 'bout them Knicks? __Stop it, stop it.__ *It's fine.* I will 'destroy' you!

## I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!

Daddy Bender, we're hungry. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!

1. Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!
2. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."
3. Is the Space Pope reptilian!?

### Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!

Leela's gonna kill me. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

* Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.
* Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
* Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.

You are the last hope of the universe. That's not soon enough! That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

Oh God, what have I done? All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.

Fatal. Fatal. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Now what? You're going to do his laundry?

Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Ummm…to eBay? Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Look, last night was a mistake.

No! The cat shelter's on to me. You lived before you met me?! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!

You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Say what? Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… Moving along… WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Anyone who laughs is a communist!

Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? How much did you make me? Then we'll go with that data file! You know, I was God once. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.

Okay, I like a challenge. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

Ummm…to eBay? Noooooo! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.
