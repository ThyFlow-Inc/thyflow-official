# Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix.

Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! Jesus must be spinning in his grave! I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die.

I can't go to juvie. __They use guys like me as currency.__ *Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie.* You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity.

## Please do not offer my god a peanut.

Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?* This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story."

1. I stand by my racial slur.
2. What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man?
3. Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work.

### We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.

…And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city!

* I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.
* How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?
* When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he's holding a gun.

Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.

Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. You don't win friends with salad. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.

Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! Ahoy hoy? What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? Inflammable means flammable? What a country.

What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs.

I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph, the secret ingredient is… Love!? Who's been screwing with this thing? Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city!

"Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion. Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.

But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me.

I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me. Me fail English? That's unpossible.

Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!

Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk. I stand by my racial slur. Ahoy hoy? Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people.

I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies. Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.
