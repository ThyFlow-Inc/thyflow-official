# All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

Did I mention we have comfy chairs? All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!

No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! __The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.__ *hellip;hey.* …the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

## You've swallowed a planet!

They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!

1. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
2. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.
3. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.

### You hit me with a cricket bat.

Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

* I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.
* Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
* The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Saving the world with meals on wheels. You hit me with a cricket bat. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.

Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!

I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
