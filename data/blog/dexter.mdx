# Like a sloth. I can do that.

I'm generally confused most of the time. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I am not a killer. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.

Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. __I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.__ *Somehow, I doubt that.* You have a good heart, Dexter.

## I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

I'm partial to air conditioning. Only you could make those words cute. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Hello, Dexter Morgan.

1. Keep your mind limber.
2. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.
3. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.

### I'm really more an apartment person.

I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. He taught me a code. To survive. I like seafood. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I'm partial to air conditioning. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

You look…perfect. I am not a killer. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. God created pudding, and then he rested. You look…perfect.

I have a dark side, too. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.

Hello, Dexter Morgan. You look…perfect. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I like seafood.

Only you could make those words cute. I like seafood. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. Makes me a … scientist.

I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I have a dark side, too. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I'm partial to air conditioning. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.

Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Like a sloth. I can do that.

Keep your mind limber. You're a killer. I catch killers. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.
